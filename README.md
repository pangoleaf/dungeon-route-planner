# dungeon-route-planner
For finding the quickest route between levels of Halaster's dungeon, based on the portals discovered so far.

Hosted at https://pangoleaf.github.io/dungeon-route-planner
For now simply query via URL parameters e.g. dungeon-route-planner/?from=8&to=3

### Problem to solve
Each level of the dungeon contains portals to other levels, as well as some sort of passageway to the previous and next levels.
Each portal is activated in a different way, so some may need to be avoided if the necessary means aren't available.
Need to provide a way of quickly finding the quickest route between any two floors.
